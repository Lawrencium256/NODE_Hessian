## Experiments on Nested N-Spheres

These experiments are used to investigate the effects of augmentation on the Hessian eigenspectrum.

There are several variations that have been performed, all of which have their own purposes. These are summarised below:

* <u>Experiments 0, 1, 2, 3:</u> Repeats of the nested N-spheres experiment from Alex's GitHub. All were done using 2D data and a Hardtanh() loss function. 
* <u>cross_entropy:</u> Nested N-spheres experiments using 2D data and a cross entropy loss.
