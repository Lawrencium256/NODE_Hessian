## Vanilla NODE Experiments

These files contain the code to run experiments on "vanilla NODEs", i.e. those without any augmentation, regularisation, etc. They have all been put into a Python Notebook format. The only one of these that I have taken any futher is the original_paper_node.ipynb file.

The file NGD_spiral.ipynb was my initial attempt to learn a spiral ODE with natural gradient descent. This was unsuccessful and became less relevant when the goal of the project became to analysis the loss surface via calculation of the Hessian.
