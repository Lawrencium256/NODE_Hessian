## Exponential Curve Fitting with Method of Finite Differences

These experiments are performed to compare the performances of the Method of Finite Differences against Library-function and ‘Manual’ approaches for Hessian calculation.

There are 2 experiments that have been performed, summarised as follows:

<ins>Experiment 1<ins>

Batch size = 100 

Batch Time = 20

Number of Iterations = 5000

Solver = dopri5

Test, Hessian Frequencies = 100

<ins>Experiment 2<ins>

Batch size = 20

Batch Time = 10

Number of Iterations = 8000

Solver = dopri5

Test, Hessian Frequencies = 100

<ins>Experiment 3<ins>

Batch size = 10

Batch Time = 10

Number of Iterations = 12000

Solver = dopri5

Test, Hessian Frequencies = 100
