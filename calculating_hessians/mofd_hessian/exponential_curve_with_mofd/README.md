## Exponential Curve Fitting with Method of Finite Differences

These experiments are performed to compare the performances of the Method of Finite Differences against Library-function and ‘Manual’ approaches for Hessian calculation.

There are 2 experiments that have been performed, summarised as follows:

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Experiment 1</span>

Batch size = 100 

Batch Time = 20

Number of Iterations = 5000

Solver = dopri5

Test, Hessian Frequencies = 100

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Experiment 2</span>

Batch size = 20

Batch Time = 10
