The file **manual_hessian.ipynb** demonstrates how to calculate the Hessian for standard neural networks. It also contains code associated with my initial failed attempts.

**manual_hessian_with_odeint.ipynb** and **original_paper_node_with_manual_hessian.ipynb** then demonstrate how to do so in the context of NODEs.
